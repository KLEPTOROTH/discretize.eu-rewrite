# Apply to Discretize

Our members are frequent and audited fractal runners. Many of us are running fractals for years now and expect fast, high quality runs. To ensure new members can fulfill these requirements a trial has to be passed in which we not only monitor your gameplay but also your attitude and personality.

As a prerequesite we expect applicants to have carefully read not only their respective build pages but also the [guides](/guides) and studied the provided material in depth. It is more important to present yourself as a player who is willing to improve than to be the perfect player already. We highly advise joining a static team and try out more advanced strategies before applying to collect experience already. To find a static you can use the `#looking-for-static` channel on our public discord server.

## <ins>We offer</ins>

- a mature community that constantly aims for improvement.
- feedback and advice on your performance
- direct contribution and input on the website
- a place to learn and discuss strategies.

  - Condi: <i>check the build guides.</i>
- **Logs:** For every build you are applying with a log for all CM bosses (for Sunqua Peak CM only condi logs are required). Logs recorded in pick up groups must be from the latest game changing patch and shouold not include a healer.

- be 18 years old or older.

## <ins>Trial Phase</ins>

To maintain our standards you are required to go through a four-week trial phase:

- First week:
  - Introduction run
  - Get acquainted with the strategies
- 2nd-4th week:
  - Use the discord LFG to create or join daily runs and submit the logs. Two full sets of logs are required per week.
  - Get detailed feedback on your logs.
  - We do not expect perfection, but progression and aim to recruit well rounded players that have knowledge about clearing fractals fast in a daily setting.
- By the End of the 4th week we expect consistent gameplay, knowledge about your class, and how it interacts with the group.

**During your trial period, you are not allowed to represent dT! You are expected to not be toxic towards any players in any game mode. Reports of toxicity lead to immediate termination of your trial.**

<Information>
  If you are already highly experienced with advanced strategies and we can very
  clearly see this from the logs you provide us with, the learning phase can be
  skipped. Whether we allow this is at our own discretion on a case-by-case
  basis. Put a note on your application if you want this to be considered.
</Information>

<br />

## <ins>**Availability**</ins>

Applying without a slot being available results in being put into a queue and invited to our internal Discord until a trial slot frees up. You are encouraged to improve yourself as you will have access to most of the channels on Discord. Feel free to ask questions from dT members or find people to play with there.

We are currently recruiting the following roles. One Power and one Condi build are required for the role you apply on.
